is irrelevant, the number of the counter and the number of
the user whose turn it is. There are two counters in the establishment.
Users receive numbers upon entry and within one day
no more than 255 users. To draw minimally
hardware connection and to write a suitable
assembly program based on ÂµP 8085A.
